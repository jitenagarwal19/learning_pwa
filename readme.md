# Test application to learn PWA and simple Webpack configuration
I wanted to learn how to setup PWA from scratch and handle everything using webpack


Once cloned just run `npm install` and then run `npm run server`
You will observe that once the application is cached using Service worker entire application is being served from local cache.

## Next steps
 * Build the webpack in a way that service worker does not require hard-coding of all the files in src folder
 * Play around with apis and see what happens then.
